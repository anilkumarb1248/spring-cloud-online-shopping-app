This is a online shopping application developed by using spring cloud.
Services are added
	config-server
	eureka-server
	search-service
	product-service
	order-service
	cart-service
	user-service
	customer-service
	shopping-gateway
	
Need to follow the order while starting the services:
First start the "Config Server" - static port - 2020 - http://localhost:2020/ConfigServer/application/default/
Next "Eureka Server" - static port - 2070 - http://localhost:2070/EurekaServer/
Next "API Gateway" - static port - 9999
	Note: without API gateway we can't access the services, using random ports for the services.

Then start the services like product, search ...

Import the Soap UI project and test the services which are added.


config-server
	To test the config server (after the server only)
		http://localhost:2020/ConfigServer/application/default/
		
		application -> is the property file name
		default -> is the environment profile, we can use dev, qa or prod alos to see specific env properties.
		
		The config server searches for the master branch, if it is not ther it will throw an error.
		We can specify the branch also where the application properties are present
		
		http://localhost:2020/ConfigServer/application/default/main
